high level languages.  The source code is distributed under the MIT License.

Conventions used in this manual
===============================

.. index::
   single: dollar sign $, shell prompt

This manual contains many examples which can be typed at the keyboard.
A command entered at the terminal is shown like this::

   $ command

The first character on the line is the terminal prompt, and should not
be typed.  The dollar sign $ is used as the standard prompt in
this manual, although some systems may use a different character.

The examples assume the use of the GNU operating system.  There may be
minor differences in the output on other systems.  The commands for
setting environment variables use the Bourne shell syntax of the
standard GNU shell (:code:`bash`).
